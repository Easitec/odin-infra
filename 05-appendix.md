## [Create a Kubernetes Cluster from the DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/how-to/create-clusters/)
1. From the Create menu in the [control panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), click Kubernetes.
1. Select a Kubernetes version. The latest version is selected by default and is the best choice if you have no specific need for an earlier version.
1. Choose a datacenter region.
1. Customize the default node pool, choose the node pool names, and add additional node pools.
1. Name the cluster, select the project you want the cluster to belong to, and optionally add a tag.
1. Click Create Cluster. Provisioning the cluster takes several minutes.
1. Download the cluster configuration file by clicking Actions, then Download Config from the cluster home page.

## API Endpoints for the OTS App
1. **POST** */secrets*
    1. Vars
        1. message - required - The message to encrypt
        1. passphrase - required - The passphrase for the message
        1. expiration_time - optional - How long for the message to persist in seconds. Default is 604800
    1. Returns JSON
        1. Vars
            1. id - unique ID of the secret for retrieval
            1. success - Boolean
    1. **POST** */secrets/<id>*
        1. Vars
            1. passphrase - required - The passphrase to unlock the secret
        1. Returns JSON
            1. Vars
                1. message - The decrypted message
                1. success - Boolean
1. If the message doesn't exist, has already been read, or has expired
    ```json
    {
        "message": "This secret either never existed or it was already read",
        "success": "False"
    }
    ```

## Use `httpie` to verify your application works in the cluster 
1. Find the IP address of your pod and copy one address to your clipboard
    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n secrets-app -o wide
    ```
1. Create a utilities pod
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/utilities.yaml
    ```
    1. Get the unique id of the pod and copy that to your clipboard.
    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n secrets-app
    ```
    
    You will see something like this:
    
    ```shell
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    one-time-secret-5b757b96f-6nbm7   1/1     Running   0          10m
    one-time-secret-5b757b96f-b9t54   1/1     Running   0          10m
    one-time-secret-5b757b96f-cjtsx   1/1     Running   0          10m
    utilities-6d8f574894-kt59m        1/1     Running   0          10s
    ```
1. Exec into that pod 
    ```shell
    kubectl exec -it <utilities_pod_name> -n secrets-app -- /bin/sh
    ```
1. Install `httpie`
    ```shell
    curl -SsL https://packages.httpie.io/deb/KEY.gpg | apt-key add - && curl -SsL -o /etc/apt/sources.list.d/httpie.list https://packages.httpie.io/deb/httpie.list && apt update && apt install httpie
    ```
    The installation will take a minute or two. 
1.  Test write 
    ```bash
    http POST <pod_ip_address>:8080/secrets message="YOUR_MESSAGE" passphrase="YOUR_PASSPHRASE"
    ```
    1. Sample Response
    ```json
    {
        "id": "ea54d2701885400cafd0c11279672c8f",
        "success": "True"
    }
    ```
1. Test read, using the id from above
    ```bash
    http POST <pod_ip_address>:8080/secrets/<id> passphrase="YOUR_PASSPHRASE"
    ```
    1. Sample Response
    ```json
    {
        "message": "Hello there",
        "success": "True"
    }
    ```
1. Exit out of the utilities pod
    ```shell
    exit
    ```

## [Destroy your cluster from the Cloud Console](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/how-to/destroy-clusters/)
1. Go to the Kubernetes page in the control panel. From the clusterâ€™s More menu, select Destroy and click Destroy. 
1. In the Destroy Kubernetes cluster dialog box, select the resources, such as load balancers and block storage volumes, associated with the cluster to delete them automatically when the cluster is deleted. Enter the name of the cluster, then click Destroy to confirm.
